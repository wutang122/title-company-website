								<h2>Technology Education</h2>

							<hr />
							<p> Cleveland rocks will teach, inspire, and promote people to become technologists. A technologist is someone who can use technology to their advantage. These people can find high-paying work easily and are capable of creating their own technology companies. Cleveland Rocks will provide classes oriented at teaching students of all ages and walk of lives. There are many beneficial aspects of learning how to use technology. The benefits of understanding how to use technology is exponential. We live in a time that is defined by technology. There are two ways to use technology, to consume and to create. The creators of technology reap the rewards of their creations while the consumers do not. It is very easy to get distracted by technology but we teach how to use technology in a beneficial way. Instead of using it as a distraction, we teach how to create and use it to better your own skill sets and life. Cleveland Rocks will offer classes on basic technology literacy to advanced classes where you will understand how to build the next major technology company.  </p>
