## How to run 

This program is a really basic django web application. There is no complicated logic besides just rendering the 4 static pages and text to run. 

Run these commands: 

`git init`
`git@github.com:kfwojton/cleveland_rocks.git`
`cd cleveland_rocks`

install this --> https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
install this --> https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/

`virtualenv myenv`
`source myenv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python manage.py runserver` 

Navigate to your browser to localhost:8000
